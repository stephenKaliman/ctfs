ENGLISH:

for each thing you submit as the value for one of the keys, make it the value of the element named <$key> in the $_SESSION array


if(array_key_exists("debug", $_GET)) {

}

ENGLISH: 

print out [DEBUG] Session contents, then print out the array of the keys as listed below.

// only allow these keys
$validkeys = array("align" => "center", "fontsize" => "100%", "bgcolor" => "yellow");
$form = "";

$form .= '<form action="index.php" method="POST">';
foreach($validkeys as $key => $defval) {
    $val = $defval;

    $val = $_SESSION[$key];
    } else {
    $_SESSION[$key] = $val;
    }

}
$form .= '<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Update" />';
$form .= '</form>';

ENGLISH:




<?
function print_credentials() { /* {{{ */
    if($_SESSION and array_key_exists("admin", $_SESSION) and $_SESSION["admin"] == 1) {
    print "You are an admin. The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
    print "<pre>Username: natas22\n";
    print "Password: <censored></pre>";
    } else {
    print "You are logged in as a regular user. Login as an admin to retrieve credentials for natas22.";
    }
}

session_start();
print_credentials();

?>

ENGLISH:

If the admin key exists and it holds the value of 1, then display the password for natas22

Walkthrough:
Start by intercepting a submission from the experimenter and then send that to the repeater
Ok so the important thing is that you can see above that the validkeys are not set until it already takes and updates the input, so you can mess with the input as it appears in the burpsuite repeater
However, you have to make sure not to mess with the submit input, because if that doesn't say "update" as its input, then nothing is gonna get changed.
So then you can change one of the names of the other forms to "admin" and its input to "1", and then hit send.
The other important thing is that for colocated websites, cookies carry over from one to the other, so you can just copy the cookie from the repeater that you just sent
and now, intercept the normal natas21 (not the experimenter), send it to the repeater, and replace the cookie that it gave you with the one you got from the repeater when you submitted admin=1 as one of the inputs
then go ahead and send it, and it should give you the password for the next level!
