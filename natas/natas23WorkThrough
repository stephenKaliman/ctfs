<?
session_start();

if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    // only admins can reveal the password
    if(!($_SESSION and array_key_exists("admin", $_SESSION) and $_SESSION["admin"] == 1)) {
    header("Location: /");
    }

<?
    if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {

ENGLISH:

if there is a revelio, then:
	if there is not (a $_SESSION array and an admin key in that array and the value 1 in that admin key)
		then change the header location to / (this will get rid of revelio if you are not an admin)
if there is still a revelio, then print out the password to natas23

It seems to work if you just send it straight to the repeater with the ?revelio=somethinghere added to the url

to be specific:
1. log in
2. turn on intercept
3. add ?revelio=somethinghere to the end of the url
4. hit enter
5. go to proxy, send to repeater
6. send
