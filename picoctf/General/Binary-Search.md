# Given
Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.
Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!

# Solution
Not really sure what to write for this, especially since the target number is randomly generated by the code.
But I guess here's an overview of how someone can do this binary search:

0. Start by noticing that the number is in the range from 1-1000, so we may as well use the range of 10-bit numbers,
0-1023. 
1. As always, start with the binary number of the proper bit count with a leading 1, followed by only 0's
2. If the checker tells us:
    - Higher: keep our current bit as a 1
    - Lower: make our current bit a 0
    - Correct: we're done!
3. Make the next bit a 1, and repeat step 2 with this bit.

This will always get you to the correct answer, assuming you have a guess for each bit in your guess length.
