# Given
Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?

# Solution
I wouldn't even really call this web exploitation, looks like they just need us to run the code somehow.

I also have never made a bookmarklet before, and making it was too much of a pain 
(the carriage returns were showing up really weird when I tried to paste it into the bookmark), 
so I just edited the function a little bit
to actually have a name, and ran it in the console.

The flag is:
```
picoCTF{p@g3_turn3r_0c0d211f}
```
