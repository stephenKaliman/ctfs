# Given
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

# Solution
As usual with "easy"-rated web challenges, just check the source code in inspector.
`Ctrl`+`f` for "pico" gives us 16 results, and we quickly find the flag:
```
picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_b99eb82e}
```
