# Given
A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again.

# Solution
Putting it through the same substitution cipher,
we get a message about CTFs and then this flag:

PICOCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_4871E6FB}

the original message doesn't seem to have
any Q's or J's in it, and it seems more
reasonable that the flag should actually be:

`picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_4871E6FB}`

which is the correct flag
