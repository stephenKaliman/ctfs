# Given

A message has come in but it seems to be all scrambled. Luckily it seems to have the key at the beginning. Can you crack this substitution cipher?

# Solution

automated substitution ciphers are pretty
good, like [this one](https://planetcalc.com/8047/)
so we can just put the full message
in there, to get

PICOCTF{5UB5717U710N_3V0LU710N_03055505}

I will come back later to add more about
how these automated solvers work
