# Given
Cryptography can be easy, 
do you know what ROT13 is? 
`cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_GYpXOHqX}`

# Solution
Just like the other one with basically the same 
problem description, we can just put this into
cyberchef's ROT13 to get:
picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_TLcKBUdK}
