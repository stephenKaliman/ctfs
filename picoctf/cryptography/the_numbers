# Given:
[this image](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/f209a32253affb6f547a585649ba4fda/the_numbers.png)

# Solution:
Looks pretty clear that it's just the numbers
of letters with 1-26 corresponding to a-z
1. Copy the text from the image 
(I did this on my phone, which is pretty good
at extracting text from images)
2. Paste into a decoder like [this](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/numbers-to-letters)
3. Make sure that spaces line up, remove braces
